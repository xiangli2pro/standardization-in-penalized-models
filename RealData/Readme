1. For simulation code:
  - Simulation_funcs.R contains all the helper functions
  - Simulation1.R conducts simulation I, generates Table 1 in the manuscript
  - Simulation2.R conducts simulation II, generates Table 2,3 in the manuscript
  
  
2. For real data example code:
  - RealData_funcs.R contains all the helper functions
  - RealData_cleaning.R detials the steps of data processing
  - RealData_models.R conducts penalized models on the standardized data
  - RealData_models_eval.R evaluates the performance of models generated from RealData_models.R and creates Table 4,5 in the manuscript
  - RealData_models_plot.R plots the Figure 1 in the manuscript
